# Inheritance

Inheritance is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. 
It is an important part of OOPs.

## What is Inheritance?

Inheritance in Java enables a class to inherit properties and actions from another class, called a superclass or parent class. 

A class derived from a superclass is called a subclass or child group. 

Through inheritance, a subclass can access members of its superclass (fields and methods), enforce reuse rules, and encourage hierarchy.

Inheritance represents the `IS-A` relationship which is also known as a parent-child relationship.

To inherit from a class, use the **extends** keyword.


## Why use inheritance in Java?
* For Method Overriding (so runtime polymorphism can be achieved).
* For Code Reusability.
